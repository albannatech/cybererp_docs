# Employee Grievance

Something has made them feel dissatisfied, and they believe it is unfair and/or unjust to them. It may or may not be justified but needs to be tackled very carefully.**

## 3. Workflow

1. The Employee creates an Employee Grievance document for their complaint or problem against Company, Employee, Department, etc.
1. The HR manager will investigate and he will fill the cause of the grievance and after that, he can change the status to Investigated. You can not set the status to **Investigated** without cause of grievance.
1. After that, the HR manager will fill in resolution details and save the Employee Grievance. You can not mark Grievance as **Resolved** without Resolution details.
1. Once the cause of Grievance and Resolution details are filled and the status is set as Resolved the document can be submitted.

> Note: You can only submit a document with **Resolved** status.
